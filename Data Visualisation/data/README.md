# Data for US Renewable Energy Usage profile visualisation

This directory contains all data and the relevant files for the data processing process of our project.

There are three directories to be concerned:
- The `tilegrid` directory contains the data files needed for creating the tile grid map
- The `usstates` directory contains the files and scripts needed for processing EIA's State Energy Data System. In this directory, the `info` directory stores the Excel file that we used to document, identify, and list the variables that we needed to calculate for our final dataset
- The `countries` directory contains the files and scripts needed for creating and processing the Countries Statistics and Energy use dataset. In this directory, there are two directories. First is the `info` directory, in which the info.xlsx file contains our documentation and identification of the variables needed for the dataset. Second is the `entities` directory, where we process the Entities dataset that provides information on all countries' names and regions/groups.

In each of the `usstates` and the `countries` directories, the `final` directory contains all dataset files that we used for our visualisations.
