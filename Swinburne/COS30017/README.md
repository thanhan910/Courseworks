# Custom App for Software Development for Mobile Devices

For the Custom App project, I chose to develop an Android CRUD Todo list app.

The source code of the app is stored in the [CustomApp](CustomApp) folder, and can be opened with Android Studio.
The .apk file of the app is [app-debug.apk](app-debug.apk).
